	<p><b>Updating The Firmware</b><br />
	You can update the firmware from a binary hex file, included in the firmware 
	directory of the application, or from a file you have downloaded from the internet.
	Or you can ask the software to check what the latest release of the firmware is via 
	the internet and then download and install it automatically.</p>
	
	<p><b>Menu -- Tools -- Check Firmware online</b><br />
	This gets the latest release number of the firmware online and if it is different 
	to the version in your connected saber asks if you wish to download and install it..</p>
	
	<p><b>Menu -- Tools -- Update Firmware from File</b><br />
	This allows you to select a firmware file, either from the firmware folder in the application
	- which normally contains the latest few firmwares - or from any other file 
	on your computer.
	
	<p>During either firmware upgrade, the software will query and store all the settings in your saber, 
	then after the upgrade, and upon re-connecting to the saber will erite all those
	settings back onto the saber.</p>
	
	<p>Installing a firmware update manually using normal development tools, 
	will reset the saber's settings back to the default if the storage format on the saber 
	has changed.</p>

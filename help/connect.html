	<p><b>Connecting Your Saber</b><br />
	Connect your saber with a good quality USB cable.</p>
	<p>Some USB cables are for charging only.</p>
	<p>Windows should make it's device connection noise when the saber is plugged in,
	Windows 10 already knows about the correct drivers for the saber and should install
	and commect automatically.</p>
	<p>Other versions of Windows may need a CDC Serial driver, you can download one from 
	<a href='http://sabers.amazer.uk/files/gilthoniel/serial_install.exe'>CDC Serial Driver Installer</a>.</p>
	
	<p><b>Selecting the Correct Serial/COM Port</b><br />
	Gilthoniel detects and connects to the correct serial port automatically,
	on the rare occassion that the saber does not connect but you are sure it 
	is the right serial port, press the disconnect/reconnect button once or twice.
	 </p>
	 <p>After making any changes and sending them to the saber, presing the close button 
	 or ending the applications will send a save command to the saber. This is not 
	 necessary as the saber saves its setting to permanent memory whenever the USB 
	 cable is disconnected.</p>

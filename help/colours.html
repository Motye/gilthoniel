	<p><b>Colours</b><br />
	The colours on the saber are generated with an RGBW (Red, Green, Blue, 
	White) array of LEDs.</p>
	<p>This is a set of four numbers each in the range 0...255.</p>
	<p>The pick a colour buttons use a colour picker that only creates a 
	colour made up of Red,Green,Blue numbers - so this has to be converted 
	to and from the RGBW colour-set for the saber.</p>
	<p>The red LED is also naturally brighter than the other three LEDs, 
	both of these issues mean the colour shown in the picker and button 
	is not an exact visual representation of the colour on the saber.</p>
	<p>Use the Preview colour button to see the colour on the saber.</p>

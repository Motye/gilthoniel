# upload.cmd
Running the upload.cmd file from Windows Explorer / the command line 
immediately flasshes the latest firmware in the folder to a connected Teensy type
saber.

The latest filename is hardcoded in the batch file.

Drag and dropping another hex file onto the batch command will flash that 
version of the firmware.

This provides a relatively easy way to flash firware to a series of sabers without 
a lot of application interface clicks.

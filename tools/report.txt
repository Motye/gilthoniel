Apologies in advance - I just killed my Anima-Evo
- was attempting to add read write files to the anima code so we can download config files and upload replacement raw sound files
- testing reading a file from the anima and it hung, now - no matter what I do - it is completely un-responsive
No click when turned off an on again
Windows does not detect it as a serial port, nor any other type of device
teensy tools do not detect it at all, nor does the tycmd uploader
